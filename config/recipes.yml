      It's best to use lettuce and tomatoes from your own garden if you can, and use a good heavy bread.

    serves: 6
    cooking_time: 3600
    preparation_time: 600
    description: A warming and delicious hearty stew
    method: |-
      Heat some olive oil in a large heavy cooking pot.
      Chop up the pancetta and chorizo into chunks and fry in the oil, with the paprika until the colour bleeds out into the oil.
      Finely chop both onions, and crush and chop the garlic.
      After a few minutes remove the pancetta and chorizo from the pan and set aside.
      Throw the onions and garlic into the pot and reduce the heat and allow them to soften and absorb the oils.
      Chop up the capsicums and throw them in too.
      Throw in the tomatoes and oregano, and pour in the chicken stock and wine.
      Cover and bring to the boil.
      Peel and chop the potatoes into medium sized chunks.
      Add the chorizo and pancetta, the potatoes, and the chickpeas.
      Stir it all in well and bring to a simmer.
      Let it simmer and reduce for about 30 to 45 minutes (until the potatoes are cooked), stirring regularly.
      Serve hot with crusty bread and some parsley.
    requirements: Make sure you have pre-cooked the chickpeas by soaking them overnight
      and cook until tender, or a 400g tin of canned chickpeas if you don't have access
      to fresh ones.
